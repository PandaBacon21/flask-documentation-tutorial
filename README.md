# flask-documentation-tutorial

This project follows along with the official Flask tutorial, located here - https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/tutorial/

This project creates a simple blog app using authentication, blueprints, templates, and static files. 

I like this project as it creates the Flask app using an application factory rather than just keepign the main app code within a main.py or app.py file. There are not many tutorials that create the app in this fashion.
